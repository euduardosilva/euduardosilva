- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @euduardosilva
When growing up, I was an avid reader, devouring detective novels, following characters like Arthur Conan Doyleâ€™s Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christieâ€™s Miss Marple. This made me, from a very young age, a very inquisitive and curious person. So, I found in Statistics a mean to investigate and understand the world.

- All of that gave me the opportunity to work in interesting topics, like Fraud prevention and Financial Services. Also gave me the opportunity to live, study and work abroad, in Spain and Chile (in the latter I worked remotely to a American Top 4 Bank).  Because of that, I have the experience of working with people from different backgrounds and different cultures, in a multilingual environment, using English, Spanish and Portuguese in a professional setting.

- Technically speaking, Iâ€™m used to applying different technologies (R, Python, SQL, SAS) to analyze complex and big data and present it in a manner that both technical and non-technical public can understand. Also, developing, deploying and managing Machine Learning models.

- If you have an interesting problem where my skills can be helpful, please feel free to contact me. :D
